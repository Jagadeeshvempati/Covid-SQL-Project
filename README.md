Here is a brief description of each section:

Data Retrieval:
The initial queries retrieve data from tables named CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations in the portfolioproject database.

Analysis of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths:
Subsequent queries focus on analyzing the COVID-19 data, calculating death percentages, infection percentages, and identifying countries with the highest infection rates and death counts.

Continent and Global Analysis:
Queries are designed to analyze COVID-19 data at the continent and global levels, showing total deaths per continent and providing global numbers.

Vaccination Analysis:
The code then shifts to analyzing vaccination data, comparing total population vs. vaccinations and creating a Common Table Expression (CTE) named PopvsVac for cumulative vaccination statistics.

Temporary Table and View Creation:
A temporary table (#PercentPeopleVaccinated) is created to store intermediate results, and data is inserted into it.
A view (PercentPopulationVaccinated) is created for later visualizations, joining COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations data.

View Query:
The final query selects data from the created view (PercentPopulationVaccinated).

In summary, this SQL code performs a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data, covering aspects like cases, deaths, vaccination rates, and creating temporary structures for data storage.
